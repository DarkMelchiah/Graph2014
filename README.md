Graph2014
=========

Small and simple algorithm that moves through a graph and find the leaves and articulation points of a given graph.

The Graph2014.java already includes 3 graphs that can be used to test the algorithm. Those can be edited so you can try it with different graph configurations.

For a next update, I'll make it so the user can add his grap via an interface or via text, following a certain format.
